Put agent/log files in here. To visualize, run Distopia as usual and then press 'd' to step forward once and 'a' to step backward
once. You can also type in a number, hit enter to go to that step, and backspace. To switch between log files inside this folder,
press the Up and Down arrow keys and the file name you are visualizing will appear.
